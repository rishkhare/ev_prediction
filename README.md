# Electric Vehicle car price prediction

This project consisted of two parts:

1. Data collection
2. Data cleaning + Model Building


## 1. Data Collection

The data on the various electric vehicles was collected from ev-database.org under their Free-Use policy. We used BeautifulSoup for scraping this data from the main webpage.


## 2. Data Cleaning + Model Building

We cleaned the data and constructed different regression models to predict the price of the electric vehicles. As found for most of the tabular data, the gradient boosted machine learning models gave the best results.
